# Hi, I'm Adam
## Welcome to the repo for my portfolio site
I left the old static version here on the master branch and deployed a more recent React.js version from the [react-refactor branch](https://github.com/adamlacasse/portfolio/tree/react-refactor) to AWS.

You can find that site at https://www.adamlacasse.com/

Happy hunting!
